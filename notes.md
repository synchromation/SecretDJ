# Notes

Append-only working journal (checkpoints skill): short dated entries as
work happens; every commit includes this file's delta.

## 2026-08-16

- Added the checkpoints skill: commit and push at every green
  checkpoint, and keep this journal — requested so work can be
  previewed as it lands. Checkpoint defined as a verifying state to
  stay compatible with the tdd loop (red is never committed).
- Context from earlier today (see git history): skills aligned with the
  Claude Fable 5 prompting guide, and the delegation skill added
  (coding tasks run in subagents on the lowest capable model tier).
- This repo has no git remote yet, so commits land locally and pushes
  aren't possible until one is configured.
